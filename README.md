# 🏫 Python OOP Student Class Project

## Project Overview

This is a simple Python project demonstrating the core principles of 
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, specifically focusing on classes, 
instance attributes, and class attributes.

The project defines a `Student` class used to manage student data within 
the "Tech Academy" context.

## ⚙️ Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

The code demonstrates the following concepts:

1.  **Class Definition:** Defining the structure for the `Student` object.
2.  **Class Attribute:** `school` is a class attribute, shared by all 
instances of `Student`.
3.  **Constructor (`__init__`):** Used to initialize the instance 
attributes (`name` and `age`) when a new student object is created.
4.  **Instance Attributes:** `name` and `age` are unique to each student 
instance.
5.  **Instance Method (`info`):** A function that operates on an 
instance's data.

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

You only need Python 3 installed on your system.

### Running the Script

1.  Save the code provided as a file named `student_data.py`.
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python student_data.py
    ```

### Expected Output

The script will print the attributes of the two student objects, followed 
by the output of the `info()` method:
